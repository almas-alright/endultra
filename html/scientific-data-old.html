        <strong> Methods: </strong>Review of many manuscripts <br />
        <strong>conclusions:</strong> Ultrasound has efficacious use in many areas of endodontics including root access refinement,                            removal of intracanal obstructions, increased action of irrigating solutions, condensation of gutta                            percha, placement of MTA, surgery and root canal preparation</p>

        <strong>Methods: </strong>Measured amount of NaOCl through the apical foramen when NaOCl was left in the canal versus passive                      ultrasonic activation of the irrigant<br />

        <strong> Methods:</strong> Tested smear layer removal using 1.0% NaOCl or water alone, or associated with 15% EDTAC between       each file size      Size 15 file ultrasonically activated in all group      SEM was used to measure the amount of smear layer<br />

      <p>5. Mozo S, et al. (2012). Review of ultrasonic irrigation in endodontics: increasing action of irrigating             solutions. Med Oral Patol Cir Bucal.<br />
        <strong> Methods:</strong> Review of existing literature (28 papers) <br />
        <strong>conclusions:</strong> The use of ultrasound in the irrigation procedure results in improved canal cleanliness, better irrigant             transfer to the canal system, soft tissue debridement, and removal of smear layer and bacteria<br>
        General consensus that PUI is more effective than conventional syringe and needle irrigation in   eliminating pulp tissue and dentin debris. This difference may be due to the fact that ultrasound creates   a higher speed and flow volume of the irrigant in the canal during irrigation, thereby eliminating more   debris, producing less apical packing, better access of the chemical product to accessory canals and even   the flush effect produced by ultrasound but not manual irrigation<br>
        The combination of conventional irrigation together with ultrasonic irrigation facilitates the procedure   and improves the elimination of bacteria and the smear layer throughout the canal system thereby   contributing to higher success rates for endodontic treatment.<br>
